## Core LangChain Capabilities

**Text Processing (Traditional Focus):**
- Document loading, splitting, and chunking
- Text embeddings and vector stores
- LLM chains and agents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt engineering and templates

**Multimodal Processing (Increasingly Common):**
- **Image Analysis**: Processing images, charts, diagrams, and visual content
- **Document Understanding**: PDFs with mixed text/images, scanned documents
- **Vision-Language Models**: Integration with GPT-4V, Claude 3, Gemini Pro Vision
- **Diagram Extraction**: Converting flowcharts, architectural diagrams, etc. into structured data

## Image/Diagram Processing in LangChain

Yes, processing images and diagrams for semantic meaning is absolutely within scope! Common approaches include:

```python
# Example: Image analysis in a LangChain workflow
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Vision-enabled model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-vision-preview")

# Process diagram/image
message = HumanMessage(content=[
    {"type": "text", "text": "Extract the workflow steps from this diagram"},
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}}
])
```

## Typical Project Scopes

**Narrow Scope**: Pure text RAG system
**Medium Scope**: Multimodal document processing (PDFs with images)
**Broad Scope**: Complete knowledge extraction from mixed media (text, images, diagrams, tables)

The trend is definitely toward broader, multimodal capabilities. Modern LangChain projects often combine text and visual processing to create more comprehensive AI systems.
